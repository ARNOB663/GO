# Go Introduction

## What is Go?
- Go is a cross-platform, open source programming language.
- Go can be used to create high-performance applications.
- Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency.
- Go was developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007.
- Go's syntax is similar to C++.

## What is Go Used For?
- Web development (server-side)
- Developing network-based programs
- Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
- Cloud-native development

## Why Use Go?
- Go is fun and easy to learn.
- Go has fast run time and compilation time.
- Go supports concurrency.
- Go has memory management.
- Go works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.).

|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Typing                         | Statically typed                    | Dynamically typed                  | Statically typed                     |
| Run time                       | Fast run time                       | Slow run time                      | Fast run time                        |
| Compilation                    | Compiled                            | Interpreted                        | Compiled                             |

| Object-Oriented Programming    | Does not support classes and objects | Has classes and objects            | Has classes and objects              |
| Inheritance                    | Does not support inheritance        | Supports inheritance               | Supports inheritance                 |
